# Stealth-Detection-Godot
A simple for of Stealth/Player Detection you can use in Godot

Create "cameras" that can see a player using raycasts
Objects can block these raycasts acting as cover
The camera can only see the player after a period of time has passed and when the player intersects with all of its rays

# How to Instantiate a Camera

1. Drag the camera scene out from the scenes folder
2. Move it around or rotate to create sightlines

# How to Create a Level

1. Drag the player scene into your level (the player moves around with the arrow keys)
2. Drag the cover scene in front of camera's lines of sight to provide cover for the player
